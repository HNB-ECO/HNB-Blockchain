## Requirements

[Go](http://golang.org/)Â 1.11 or newer.

## Installation
#### Linux/BSD/MacOSX/POSIX - Build from Source

- Install Go according to the installation instructions here:
  http://golang.org/doc/install

- Ensure Go was installed properly and is a supported version:

```bash
$ go version
$ go env GOROOT GOPATH
```

NOTE: The `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` above must not be the same path.  It is
recommended that `GOPATH` is set to a directory in your home directory such as
`~/goprojects` to avoid write permission issues.  It is also recommended to add
`$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH` at this point.

- Run the following commands to obtain hnb, all dependencies, and install it:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/Masterminds/glide
$ git clone https://github.com/HNB-ECO/HNB-Blockchain.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/HNB-ECO/HNB-Blockchain/
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/HNB-ECO/HNB-Blockchain/HNB
$ glide install
$ cd start
$ go build start.go
```
## Getting Started

hnb has several configuration options available to tweak how it runs, but all
of the basic operations described in the intro section work with zero
configuration.

#### Linux/BSD/POSIX/Source

```bash
$ ./start
```
