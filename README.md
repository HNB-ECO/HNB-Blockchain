## HNB-Blockchain
A Next-Generation Decentralized Economic Community

HNB system is designed to enable the founding of sustainable economic model to serve real business entities. The goal is to use HNB system to build a next generation of blockchain-based decentralized economic entity serving an economic ecosystem comprised of over 100 million of consumers and merchants. The HNB economy of scale and its members are ever-increasing as the ecosystem grows. 

+ Innovative consensus mechanism to support multiple nodes to reach consensus speedily
+ Dual-chain and dual-token assets : HNB and HGS
+ Algorithm bank to regulate the stability of HGS
+ Robust and vital DApp collection and agile lightweight SDK to support easy integration with merchant applications
+ Support smart contract and multiple side chains
+ High performance and great scalability to support off-chain liquidity network technologies
+ Strong security and powerful cryptographic capability

|Layer          |Description    |
|:-------------:|:------------- |
|Contract Layer|Contract layer provides the services of life cycle management, operation cost management, run-time environment, formal verification for smart contracts. HNB smart contracts are developed by advanced programming languages such as Golang and JavaScript which not only meet Turing completeness but also ensure smart contracts to be executed smoothly and safely by their mature run-time environments.|
|Consensus Layer|Consensus layer adopts hybrid consensus mechanism of blending DPoS and Algorand, encouraging the nodes making great contributions in HNB community to participate in accounting, ensuring fair voting on consensus of delegates based on encrypted sortition, ultimately achieving efficiency and consistency of consensus process through consensus algorithms.|
|Incentive Layer|Incentive layer provides open, transparent, unified incentive strategy management based on the design of algorithm bank in HNB ecosystem. HGS digital assets are rewarded to the nodes making great contributions in the community.|
|Data Layer|Data layer is the granularity of decentralized database and decentralized storage in HNB infrastructure layer, described in blockchain technology architecture. It provides storage service for decentralized database and decentralized filesystem, supporting HNB dual-token asset ledge management. |
|Network Layer|Network layer is the infrastructure module providing network communication. Its functions include providing interfaces for blockchain infrastructure layer to access applications, providing P2P network for blockchain nodes and broadcast among blockchain nodes. |
|Security Layer|Security layer is the HNB solution to address demanding security requirements of blockchain through the analysis of four security pillars of communication, data, contract and key.|
|Infrastructure Layer|Infrastructure layer provides foundational services for blockchain including cryptographic algorithm library, node management, multi-asset chain management, account management, transaction and event management.|
